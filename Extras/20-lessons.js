// I need to learn bit manipulation and bit vectors
// Overall I think things went well. I am able to solve most of these problems in 30 mins or less.
// The struggle is in problems that a so large it is hard to even think through a solution.
// I think reviewing solutions on LeetCode is a good idea (the upvoted solutions)
// Many (top rated) leetcode solutions are very good, short and appear optimal.
// I have a plan for the next few weeks - mainly math, and the next few relavent chapters of CTCI
// I'll need to think of a way to continue to add commits.
// I am also making the master list of all things to know before interviews, maybe I can spend some additional
// time on the master list.

// Goals are 1) Problem Solving, 2) Math, 3) Javascript/OOD mastery, 4) good interview skills
