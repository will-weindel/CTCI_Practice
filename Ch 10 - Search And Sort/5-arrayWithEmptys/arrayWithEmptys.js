// The general idea is to use a modified Binary Search to look through the array
// However, worst case scenary is O(n). It could be argued that for sake of clarity
// and code maintainance, a simple linear search would suffice.
// Additionally, a recurse BS will use extra space (in stack).
// An iterative approach may be better
