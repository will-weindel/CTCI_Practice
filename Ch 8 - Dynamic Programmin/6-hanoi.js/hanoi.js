// I - number of disks
// O - set of towers
// C - Time (w/o memo) is O(2^n)
// E - 0 towers

// create a Towers Of Hanoi class (factory function) with 3 stacks
// create a move method
// create an initialize method
// move method will have a recurse function which takes a val, source tower, buffer tower and desintation tower.
// begin at base case and work backwards
