// I - string (unique chars)
// O - all permutations
// C - Time (extreme, worse than factorial) | Space (worse than factorial)
// E - n/a

// loop through previous set of permutations and add a new letter to each perm
// the new letter should be added before and after each letter of the previous perms
// be sure to add new perms to the end of the cache (saving the previous cache)
