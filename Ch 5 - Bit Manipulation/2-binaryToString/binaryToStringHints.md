To wrap your head around the problem, try thinking about how you'd do it for integers.

In a number like • 893 (in base 10), what does each digit signify? What then does each
digit in .10010 signify in base 2?

A number such as • 893 (in base 10) indicates 8 _ 10-1 + 9 _ 10-2 + 3 \* 10-3
• Translate this system into base 2.

How would you get the first digit in • 893? If you multiplied by 10, you'd shift the values
over to get 8. 93. What happens if you multiply by 2?

Think about what happens for values that can't be represented accurately in binary.
