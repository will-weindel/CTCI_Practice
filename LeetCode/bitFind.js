//Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

//You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

// I - an array with a unique value (all other vals have pairs)
// O - the unique number
// C - Time O(n) | Space O(1) | number range | length range | type range
// E - none number types
