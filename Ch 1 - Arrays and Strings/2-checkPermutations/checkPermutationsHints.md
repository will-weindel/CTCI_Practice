Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other. Now, look at
that definition you provided. Can you check the strings against that definition?

There is one solution that is 0( N log N) time. Another solution uses some space, but
isO(N) time.

Could a hash table be useful?

Two strings that are permutations should have the same characters, but in different
orders. Can you make the orders the same?
