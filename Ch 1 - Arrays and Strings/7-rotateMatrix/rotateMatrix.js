//Given an image represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel in the image is represented by an integer, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

//I - N X N matrix
//O - rotatedMatrix (90)
//C - Disquals? Not NxN? Unique numbers
//E - no input, wrong input etc.

//Dis - N/A
//Da - N/A
//A-P - double for-loop
//T - n/a

function rotateMatrix(matrix) {
  //EVERYTHING MUST ROTATE!
}
