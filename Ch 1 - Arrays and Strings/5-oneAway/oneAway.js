//There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

//I - two strings
//O - bool
//C - single words, spaces (trimming), check for data types
//E - none

//Ds - strings greater than 1 diff in length
//Da - n/a
//Al - recursion
//T - n/a

function oneAway(str1, str2) {
  //take your code, and put it here
}
