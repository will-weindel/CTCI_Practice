We could consider keeping a single linked list for dogs and cats, and then iterating
through it to find the first dog (or cat). What is the impact of doing this?

Let's suppose we kept separate lists for dogs and cats. How would we find the oldest
animal of any type? Be creative!

Think about how you'd do it in real life. You have a list of dogs in chronological order and
a list of cats in chronological order. What data would you need to find the oldest animal?
How would you maintain this data?
